# Youtube-Data-Analysis-Report

Produced a data analysis report to determine the best day to upload a YouTube video for a channel 
by developing a Python program to collect viewership data for 147 days for cleaning, visualizing, 
and analyzing in MS Excel to investigate which days have the highest average metrics, and 
concluded that Fridays are best to upload high-effort videos. Also investigated the best types of
videos to upload and which days of the week are the worst to upload on.
